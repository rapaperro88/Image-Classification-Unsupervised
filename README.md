## Objectives

The aim of this project is to build a multi-tool ensemble for **classifying images by clustering**, using unsupervised ML algorithms. This may include the following features:

* Image Analysis & Classification (backend): 
  1. Preprocessing
  2. Implementation of an unsupervised ML technique : image clustering
  3. Return the images list and their assigned class
  4. Get feedback to improve the ML algorithm (**Kmeans, DBscan**)
* Data Manipulation & Storage (backend):
  1. Storing the Data in a Database (**MongoDB**)
  2. Deploy Database
* User Interaction (frontend):
  1. Interface (**Streamlit**) that:
     1. Loads images
     2. Runs the classification algorithm
     3. Returns the results (images list + classes)
     4. Receives feedback to improve the algorithm
  2. Interface deployed (**Render**)
